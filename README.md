# skinfetcher
This is a skin fetcher used to quickly search for skins for Teeworlds on multiple websites.
This is the first version and may be increadable unstable. some options have not been fully made, and more websites will become available as time goes on.
if you find a critical error within the code please report it to me on my discord: Tyler the chad#3168


⭐ What i want to do with this project: ⭐
1. add more websites
2. add a downloadable feature to automatically download the skin from the website for you.
3. make ui nicer and easier to read
4. be able to search all websites at once feature
5. intergrate into a discord bot <-- might not happen we will see!
 ------------
 Current things im working on at the moment: 
1.  adding more websites.
2.  makeing ui nicer and easier to read.

  Warning:
  Please do not copy my code :) thanks!
  im still new to programming so the code may be very basic, i aim to take anything i learn in programming to make this project better!
  i am also the only person working on this project so it will take me a bit of time!
